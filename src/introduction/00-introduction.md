# Introduction

Tide is a minimal and pragmatic Rust web application framework built for
rapid development. It comes with a robust set of features that make building
async web applications and APIs easier and more fun.

This Tide-book is still a work in progress, and will be expanded on over time.

All examples in the text are available as [working Tide-projects](https://github.com/http-rs/tide-book/tree/main/examples)
